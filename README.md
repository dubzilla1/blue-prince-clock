# Blue Prince Timer (Angular Starter)

This is a simple app I made to help keep track of the time of day in Blue Prince.  It starts at 8AM and runs at 7.5x real time, simulating the time of day in Blue Prince.  If you start this app when you start your day, you'll always have a handy dandy clock by your side.

If you don't know why this is useful in Blue Prince, then feel free to come back once you do!
