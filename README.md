# Blue Prince Timer (Angular Starter)

This is a simple app I made to help keep track of the time of day in Blue Prince.  It starts at 8AM and runs at 7.5x real time, simulating the time of day in Blue Prince.  If you start this app when you start your day, you'll always have a handy dandy clock by your side.

If you don't know why this is useful in Blue Prince, then feel free to come back once you do!

Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

Setup (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\jason\dev\blue-prince-timer"
npm install
npm start
```

What I created
- `package.json`, `angular.json`, `tsconfig.json`
- `src/` with `main.ts`, `index.html`, `styles.scss`, and a minimal `app/` with App, Home, About components

Next steps
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- If you want, I can update Node for you or run `npm install` and `npm start` in this workspace now.
