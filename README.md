# Blue Prince Timer (Angular Starter)

This is a minimal Angular workspace scaffold created by the assistant.

Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

Setup (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\jason\dev\blue-prince-timer"
npm install
npm start
```

What I created
- `package.json`, `angular.json`, `tsconfig.json`
- `src/` with `main.ts`, `index.html`, `styles.scss`, and a minimal `app/` with App, Home, About components

Next steps
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- If you want, I can update Node for you or run `npm install` and `npm start` in this workspace now.
